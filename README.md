# Ionic Data Trust Services for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

The Ionic Data Trust Services for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage integration offers a simple way for developers building atop Microsoft's Azure Storage SDK for Java to invoke Ionic's protection and policy functionality as data moves to and from Azure Blob Storage. This addresses use cases such as migration from on-prem storage solutions, protecting data across multi-region or multi-cloud environments, applying granular cryptographic control, and more.
